new PathContext much improved for drawing outlines.

TODO:
- Rounded Rectangles and Arcs for PathContext in progress
- fix occasional edge cases for thickness trig related perhaps actually js error.
- improve stability
- add fill to PathContext.
- add isolated lines round edge to general PathContext?
- Explore further combinations of mixing with fill libraries.
